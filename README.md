# De Zomerse Nachten PWA

This is the repository of the Progressive Web App of a side project of mine. It's merely used as an experiment to test real world case uses of a PWA among multiple platforms.

It uses the following frameworks and systems to run on:
* Angular 1 (as web app framework)
* Google Material Design Lite (for styling and layout components)
* Firebase (for database, authentication and other stuff that a web app needs nowadays, AngularFire is 'bowered' because of its ability to play super nice with Angular)
* Rollbar (for error reporting)
* Gulp (build tool)
* Karma (browser testing)

## Zomerse Nachten database
The database needs to store multiple objects:
* Users
* Events
